I started the ssh-agent in one terminal window and ran a script that adds and
removes keys into it; so the vulnerable program is (the `-c 8` is the target cpu):

```
$ eval $(taskset -c 7 ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 891162
$ cat ssh-loop.sh
#!/bin/sh -x

  while true; do
    taskset -c 7 ssh-add -D
    taskset -c 8 ssh-add ~/dummy_rsa
  done
$ ./ssh-loop.sh
```

(It will print a lot of garbage.)

You can test whether `ssh-add` actually reads the `~/dummy_rsa`, by running.

```
while true; do inotifywait ~/dummy_rsa; done
```

On the attacker side (second terminal window, the same compter), I was running

```
taskset -c 2 ./leak
```

Nothing worked ðŸ¤·.
